# Cisco Sample Code | Cookiecutter Project Template

*Create a Cisco Sample Code project from this language-agnostic project template.*

Every project needs a start.  This [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) project template makes it easy for you to start a *Cisco Sample Code* project using the [Cisco Sample Code License](./LICENSE) with minimal (but engaging!) project documentation.

## How does this template make my life easier?

> One command and your project directory is set up and ready for you to start coding.

The template includes the necessary license file and text copy needed to share your Cisco Sample Code project publicly and recommended starter docs to get your project off to a great start.

## Using the Project Template

### The First Time

```bash
$ cookiecutter https://github.com/CiscoSE/cc-cisco-sample-code
```

...or using abbreviated syntax:

```bash
$ cookiecutter gh:CiscoSE/cc-cisco-sample-code
```

### Thereafter

```bash
$ cookiecutter cc-cisco-sample-code
```

## Installation

You don't have to know Python syntax or write Python code to create and use Cookiecutter templates, but you do need Python and the Cookiecutter tool installed on your workstation.

If you have a working Python development environment, installation is simple:

```bash
$ pip install cookiecutter
```

If you need a bit more help than that, see the [Installation](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) page of the Cookiecutter docs.

## Who is this for?

This project template is for use by **Cisco Systems Engineers** who are creating example and demonstration code *(aka. Cisco Sample Code)* and sharing it with Cisco's customers and partners for use with Cisco products and services.  **The Cisco Sample Code License is for use in Cisco Repositories Only.**  It is not an Open Source license. The license should only be used by Cisco and/or its affiliates to post and share Cisco Sample Code.
